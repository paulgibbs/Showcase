Showcase helps you manage a list of featured websites on your WordPress site; similar to http://wordpress.org/showcase/.

Built with theme compatibility (think bbPress, BuddyPress, and Achievements) and using sub-action techniques, this is a good example of how to structure a modern WordPress plugin.
